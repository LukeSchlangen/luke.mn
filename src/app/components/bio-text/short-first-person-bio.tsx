    <p>
      I am a Developer Advocate for Google Kubernetes Engine who believes learning follows excitement.
      I find it rewarding to give approachable talks for beginners, because everyone is a beginner at something.
      I previously taught at a coding bootcamp.
      After that, I led an onboarding program for new software engineers at a Fortune 500 company.
      Now at Google, I like to introduce newcomers to containers and Kubernetes.
